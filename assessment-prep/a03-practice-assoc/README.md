# Stock Academy

We'll take **45min** for this part of the assesment.

**NB: Run `bundle install` before you get started.**

Next, set up the database:

    ./setup_db.sh

Welcome to the finance world. We have been tasked to develop an
application for Stock Academy that will allow them to keep track of
users and their watchlists of companies, prices, and executives.

Your task today is to build the relationships between all of these
models. The database has already been setup and the models have been
annotated with their respective table schemas.

## Assignment

The specs (`bundle exec rspec`) will guide you through building a
series of associations. Refer to the `db/schema.rb` file to find the
format of the database; this will especially help you find the name of
foreign keys.

I would start by building `has_many`, `belongs_to` and `has_one`
associations. I would later build the `has_many :through`
associations.

For any associations that requires any a non-default option, (i.e.
you have to specify `class_name`, `foreign_key`, `primary_key`, or
`source` for the association to work), please specify all options.

## Brief Description

Make sure to be looking at the specs and the `db/schema.rb`. Part of
your job is to be able to understand the structure and interrelations
of the data from these sources.

We provide a brief overview. Users of the site create WatchLists to
track the market. A WatchList consists of WatchListItems, each of which
tracks a Company for a given period of time.

A Company is controlled by a Board. A Board is comprised of
Executives; an Executive can sit on multiple Boards.

Each Company is listed on an Exchange. Lastly, we record the Price of
the Company each day.
